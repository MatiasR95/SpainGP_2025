# 🏎️ Formula 1 SQL Analysis (1950–2024)

Welcome to my personal SQL project analyzing historical Formula 1 data, designed to improve my data analysis skills while combining my love for motorsport. This practice was inspired by the debut of **Franco Colapinto**, the first Argentine driver in F1 in decades — Vamos Franco! 🇦🇷

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository is organized into four main parts, each focused on different analytical goals using SQL:

### 1. `01_EDA/eda_queries.sql`
Basic exploratory data analysis:
- Table listings
- Circuit breakdowns
- Driver participation
- Status summaries and points per position

### 2. `02_Historical_Insights/historical_queries.sql`
Insightful trends from 1991–2024:
- Pole positions
- Constructor wins by decade
- Finish rates and podium counts
- DNF and qualifying patterns

### 3. `03_Colapinto_Strategy/colapinto_focus.sql`
A personal section devoted to strategic insights for Franco Colapinto:
- Argentinian driver stats
- Points by grid
- Rookie and overtaking trends
- Position changes and Q3 consistency

### 4. `04_Report_Ready/report_tasks.sql`
High-level metrics ready for dashboards:
- Points probability
- Pole-to-win conversions
- Constructor consistency
- Position gain probabilities

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Formula 1 World Championship (1950–2020)** dataset from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Formula 1 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)

> ⚠️ To follow all queries in this repo:
1. Download the Kaggle dataset above.
2. Load the CSV files into a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
3. Adjust date formats and table names if needed, based on your DBMS.
4. Run each `.sql` file in the given order or independently for specific insights.

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Create a local SQL database from the Kaggle CSV files.
2. Run the scripts in order from `01_EDA` to `04_Report_Ready` or selectively.
3. Use a client like DBeaver, pgAdmin, or MySQL Workbench for running and visualizing queries.
